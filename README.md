# State of Solar
This website tracks solar energy deployment on a state-by-state basis - specifically focusing on:

- Total number of installations
- Average cost of solar ($/watt)
- Total number of solar policies

The user interacts with a map of the USA and will view a state's data through a pop-up modal.

The site was built with Rafaeljs, AJAX, Jquery, SCSS, and uses 2 of NREL's open-sourced APIs.
